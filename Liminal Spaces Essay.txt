From my personal experience, liminal spaces are a relatively recently popularized concept. They are a big part of internet horror, features on reels and tiktok videos, and they seem to be growing (recently I saw a video corresponding the viewer’s birth month to various types of liminal spaces).
Searching liminal space on Google Images brings up images of malls, rec centers, pools, hallways and hotels. Central features of these images is that they are never populated, the color palette used in the images is often dull or desaturated, and they all feature marked use of perspective lines, with scenes receding far back into the picture plane, emphasizing the wide emptiness of the space.
Putting the same search into Pinterest yields slightly more artistic results, and one thing that I noticed was that while searching, the term liminal space aesthetic was a suggested term. The images on Pinterest are more brightly colored, feature more diverse settings, such as stairwells and offices, playgrounds, fields, bowling alleys, and gas stations. Once again, there are no people in the images, and the images seem more emotionally enticing that those off of google.
Researching liminal spaces brought up articles from mental health websites such as VeryWellMind and Forbes Health. These sites define liminality as, “the place a person is in during a transitional period. It’s a gap, and can be physical (like a doorway), emotional (like a divorce) or metaphorical (like a decision)” (Forbes). So it's about the transition periods people have in their lives, where there is a sense of unease and discomfort because of a lack of security or familiarity in the environment. Physical liminal spaces are not something you would aim to stay long term in, which is why staying with them, being forced to focus on them can feel discombobulating. The Forbes article says that often, we are moving through liminal spaces and don’t realize it, for example, hallways, staircases, doorways and bridges. VeryWellMind also lists airports, airplanes, and trains as liminal spaces. It lists illness, moving, and graduations as examples of emotional liminal spaces.
Clearly, the images people are intentionally crafting to represent liminal spaces have this feeling of something being off with them. According to Forbes, we don’t notice these spaces unless something doesn’t seem right about them, for example walking down an empty street and hearing footsteps somewhere when there's no one.
I wonder why people are attracted to them, it's the subject of another essay I'm producing right now. I think that something about liminal spaces is similar to socially unconventional subjects like perversion, taboo, and repression, which are all fascinating to me. In general, I think emotional liminal spaces are something that people generally avoid, because they are unpleasant feelings, and in line with the general desire to be productive, to be doing things. Being in a space where you are powerless and insecure is repulsive, and opposite to this productive mentality.
Maybe people are attracted to them because they are so clearly distanced from modern life, and can be a mental escape, maybe the lack of people in the images is cathartic. Personally, I find it refreshing to be wrapped up in an atmosphere that is so sensorily different from waking life. It’s an exploration.
I think the representation of liminality is mostly through images. The Backrooms is a very popular video game with lore coming from 4chan. According to Wikipedia, “Images depicting liminal spaces gained popularity in 2019 when a short [creepypasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creepypasta) of unknown origin was posted on [4chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan) and went viral.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminal_space_(aesthetic)#cite_note-6) The creepypasta showed an image exemplifying a liminal space—a hallway with yellow carpets and wallpaper—with a caption purporting that by "[noclipping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noclip_mode) out of bounds in real life", one may enter [the Backrooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Backrooms), an empty wasteland of corridors with nothing but "the stink of old moist carpet, the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background noise of fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz, and approximately six hundred million square miles of randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in".[7]”
It's interesting to me that the Backrooms suggests that these liminal spaces are related to the afterlife. Like it's something comparable to heaven or hell.
Related to the concept of liminal spaces is the uncanny valley, though the mental effect of the uncanny valley is more typically geared towards humanoid things, rather than spaces. I would say that it would not be a stretch to apply this uncanny valley effect— extreme and sudden revulsion towards something that closely resembles, but is clearly not completely human— could be seen in how people react to hallways that seem longing, like they are missing something fundamentally human in them, even though they appear to be functional as a hallway. Maybe it is about the lack of humanity in anything. Whether it be an object, person, pet, or place.
brainstorm:
things involved in synesthesia: possible subjects of mental conversion: time units, general sounds, personalities, pain, orgasm, emotion > pain, kinetics, temperatures. 
so maybe taking these sensory experiences and then taking the soul out of them
celine dion, being an instrument of the sound, emphasizing emotion but clearly advertising herself as a front, as an honest illusion. forget what the source is. lets talk about….
