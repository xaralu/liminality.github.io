<!-- This is the page for the back section
    current idea is to put some sort of image on here for a spil second, 
    when the back button is pressed, it can not be pressed again, javascript function that replaces it with a link to a file that does not exists, so taht it displays error 404
    going to just have one image on here, which will be floated to the left and take up the entire half of the screen. 
    what will this image be? maybe one of the supernatural things in the backroom?
